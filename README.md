# A Pathogenicity Accessory Chromosome in *Fusarium oxysporum* f. sp. *vasinfectum*

**Author:** Lihui Xiang

## 📘 Project Overview

This repository accompanies the R Markdown analysis report for the project _"A Pathogenicity Accessory Chromosome in *Fusarium oxysporum* f. sp. *vasinfectum* (Fov)"_, which investigates a unique accessory chromosome implicated in virulence on cotton.

We explored the role of horizontally-transferred genetic elements by:
- Identifying a lactamase gene cluster on an accessory chromosome of strain 89-1A.
- Tagging this chromosome with GFP and isolating chromosome-lost mutants.
- Performing virulence assays and gene expression profiling.
- Evaluating genome completeness via BUSCO and validating qPCR primer efficiencies.

## 🧪 Main Features

- **Genome Quality Assessment** using BUSCO
- **Gene Localization & Candidate Selection** from accessory chromosome
- **qPCR Primer Efficiency Testing** (2^-ΔΔCt method)
- **Expression Profiling** of 8 target genes across 5 infection time points
- **Virulence Testing** of GFP-tagged and chromosome-lost isolates
